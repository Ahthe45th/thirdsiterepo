Mama Ngina Kenyatta

Businesswoman and Matriarch of the Kenyatta Family

Before independence had a flag, Ngina Muhoho was already part of its story — born in 1933 in Kiambu, daughter of Chief Muhoho wa Gathecha, a lineage both revered and burdened by colonial intrigue.  At eighteen she married Jomo Kenyatta, a man twice her age and already tethered to destiny.

Through the turbulence of detention and the birth of a nation, she moved beside him with a poise that concealed calculation.  As Kenya transformed, so did she — from First Lady to business strategist, from symbol to shareholder.

After Jomo’s death in 1978, she stepped from the public balcony into the engine room of family enterprise.  Land, dairy, hospitality, banking, media — she tied them into a lattice of holdings that would survive governments and gossip alike.  Brookside Dairies, Heritage Hotels, Media Max, NCBA Bank: all bore her steady imprint.

She rarely speaks in public.  Her power moves in silence — contracts, share registers, land titles whispered across generations.  Admirers call it prudence; critics, privilege.  Perhaps it is both.  What cannot be denied is her mastery of continuity.

In 2021, the state conferred on her the Elder of the Order of the Golden Heart.  But her real decoration is endurance — six decades of influence wrapped in discretion.  In the lexicon of Kenyan power, Mama Ngina is not merely a name.  She is a system.
