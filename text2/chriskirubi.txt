Chris Kirubi

Industrialist, Investor, Media Tycoon

On a weekday morning in Nairobi’s Kileleshwa neighborhood, the gates of Capital FM swing open, and the hum of pop music drifts into the compound. In one of the station’s glass studios, a photograph of the late Chris Kirubi hangs beside the console—a sharp suit, easy smile, and the hint of defiance in his eyes. To many young Kenyans, he was not just a businessman. He was proof that ambition could start from nowhere and still fill a skyline.

Kirubi was born in 1941 in Nairobi, during colonial rule, into a family that had little and lost early. Orphaned as a child, he spent his youth between relatives’ homes, taking on small jobs to survive. “I was selling whatever I could get,” he once said. “Poverty was my first boss.”

Education became his way out. He studied at Friends School Kamusinga, a rare opportunity for a boy of his background, then earned a scholarship to study in Germany. There he learned business management and absorbed a country rebuilding itself from war—a place where discipline was currency and failure, instruction.

When he returned to Kenya, he joined Shell as a salesman and quickly realized he was better suited to risk than routine. In the 1970s, Nairobi’s property market was riddled with neglected buildings, abandoned after independence. Kirubi began buying them—cheap, broken, unwanted—and renovating them for rent. The gamble worked. Real estate became his first fortune.

He reinvested aggressively, acquiring Haco Industries and transforming it into a manufacturer of household products. Later, through Centum Investments, he took stakes in energy, finance, and technology. His reach stretched from factories to boardrooms, always guided by a simple credo: “You must make money work for you.”

In the 1990s, Kirubi ventured into media, purchasing Capital FM. The move baffled some contemporaries but cemented his cultural influence. The station became a platform for urban music, youth dialogue, and entrepreneurship. On-air, he sometimes appeared as “DJ CK,” offering life lessons between songs. His social media posts—equal parts humor and hustle—earned him a following that blurred the line between tycoon and mentor.

Behind the flash was method. He mentored dozens of young executives, invested in startups, and spoke candidly about wealth creation. Yet he was also polarizing—admired for his success, criticized for his confidence. “If you don’t believe in yourself,” he said in one of his final interviews, “no one else will.”

In 2017, Kirubi was diagnosed with cancer. He continued to work through treatment, often sharing updates online. “I don’t fear death,” he told his followers. “I fear not living enough.”

He died in June 2021, at 80. At his memorial, employees from his companies—factory hands, accountants, radio hosts—lined up to speak. They remembered him not only for wealth, but for the phone calls at dawn, the laughter in the corridor, the man who demanded excellence and made others believe they could reach it.

Outside Capital FM, the music plays on. The photograph remains—a reminder of the boy who sold odds and ends in colonial Nairobi, who built an empire in independent Kenya, and who, in the end, taught a generation that confidence, too, is a kind of capital.
