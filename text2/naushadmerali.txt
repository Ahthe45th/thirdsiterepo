Naushad Merali

Founder, Sameer Group

In a quiet corner office at Sameer Business Park—his flagship development on Nairobi’s Mombasa Road—the late Naushad Merali often worked with the blinds half-drawn, the light falling in thin stripes across his desk. His voice was soft, his phone calls brief. “He didn’t raise his tone,” a longtime associate recalled. “He just raised the stakes.”

Merali was born on January 1, 1951, in Nairobi, to an Ismaili Muslim family that prized discipline and modesty over display. His father ran a small business; his mother managed the home. Friends from his early years remember him as precise and curious, the kind of boy who noticed how things were priced and who kept mental tallies of who owed what.

He attended Highway Secondary School and later left for the United Kingdom, where he trained as an accountant. In the cool precision of British finance, he found a language that suited him. But he returned to Kenya in the 1970s, convinced that opportunity was not something to seek abroad, but to create at home.

His first real breakthrough came through Ryce Motors, a struggling car dealership. Merali saw inefficiency where others saw failure. He bought a stake, streamlined operations, and turned a profit. The formula stuck. Over the next decades he built the Sameer Group—a holding company that would stretch across finance, manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.

Merali’s genius lay not in invention, but in timing. He had a knack for arriving at the hinge moments of Kenya’s economy—when deregulation opened markets, when foreign investors sought local partners, when a public company needed a quiet buyer. In 2004, he famously made over $20 million in hours, flipping his stake in mobile network Kencell to Celtel after first buying it from Vivendi. The transaction became legend in Nairobi’s financial circles: part audacity, part foresight.

Yet away from the headlines, he remained private to the point of reticence. Employees described a leader who expected results but never performed authority. “He’d walk the corridors, greet everyone by name,” said one former executive. “You always felt seen.”

His philanthropy followed the same pattern: deliberate, understated. Through the Zarina and Naushad Merali Foundation, he funded hospitals, special-needs schools, and programs for children with disabilities. During interviews, he avoided grand declarations, preferring to talk about “building things that last.”

In 2021, when news of his death broke, tributes poured in not just from politicians and executives, but from factory workers, drivers, and long-time employees who had stayed with him for decades. Many spoke of a boss who believed business was not a performance, but a duty.

From the rooftop of Sameer Business Park, planes from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport trace their descent across Nairobi’s sky—symbols of motion, precision, and arrival. They mirror something of Merali’s own life: quiet takeoffs, exact landings, and a legacy measured not in applause, but in endurance.
