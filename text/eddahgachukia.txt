Dr. Eddah Gachukia

Educator, Policy Advocate, Co-founder, Riara Group of Schools

At 8 a.m. assembly at Riara Primary in Nairobi, students in maroon sweaters recite the school creed in unison. Teachers record attendance on tablets instead of paper registers. Standing at the edge of the courtyard, Dr. Eddah Wanjiru Gachukia watches quietly. The school, now part of a multi-campus education group, began in her living room.

Born in 1936 in Kiambu County, central Kenya, Gachukia grew up under colonial rule, when African girls were often tracked toward domestic work, not professional training. Her parents pushed past that ceiling early. She attended Alliance Girls’ High School, then one of the few secondary institutions admitting African girls, and later enrolled at Makerere University in Uganda, East Africa’s leading postcolonial intellectual center.

She went on to earn a PhD in Education at the University of Nairobi, placing herself inside Kenya’s first wave of female academic leadership. In the 1960s and 1970s she taught and later held senior administrative roles at the university. She also worked with the Ministry of Education and international bodies including UNESCO, where she focused on curriculum development and girls’ access to schooling.

Her shift from public policy to private infrastructure came in 1974, when she and her husband, Daniel “Dan” Gachukia, registered what became the Riara Group of Schools. The first school was a kindergarten with a handful of students. Over five decades, Riara expanded into primary, secondary and eventually tertiary education, culminating in Riara University. The group is now regarded as one of Kenya’s most stable privately run education systems, with a model built on continuity rather than franchising.

Gachukia’s operating theory is straightforward: academic quality is a governance problem, not a slogans problem. Riara emphasizes small classroom ratios, continuous assessment, and teacher retention in a market where private schools often scale fast and burn out. Former staff say she tracks performance indicators personally and expects written justification for any deviation from standard.

Her influence extends beyond her own schools. She helped establish the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE), which pushed governments across the continent to legislate for girls’ enrollment, reduce early marriage pressure and keep pregnant teens in classrooms. That advocacy—rooted in data and policy briefs rather than protest rhetoric—shifted national education debates in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

For her work, Gachukia has received senior state honors, including Moran of the Order of the Burning Spear (MBS) and Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear (EBS). She has also served as a nominated Member of Parliament, using that seat to insert education language directly into legislative process.

Inside Riara today, her presence still functions as internal audit. “She will walk a corridor and know if something is off,” said one longtime teacher. “It’s operational, not symbolic.”

At 89, she describes education as national infrastructure. Her view is blunt: “If you outsource the minds of your children, you lose the country.”
