Jimnah Mwangi Mbaru

Investment Banker, Founder of Dyer & Blair Investment Bank

From his 14th-floor office overlooking Nairobi’s Upper Hill, Jimnah Mbaru still keeps a terminal tuned to live trading screens. The Kenyan stock market no longer moves with the volatility it once did, but for Mbaru, now in his seventies, price is still the best measure of trust.

Born in 1949 in Murang’a County, Mbaru grew up in a household that balanced discipline with ambition. His father was a provincial administrator, his mother a teacher. They valued education as an investment rather than a luxury. After attending Kahuhia Secondary and Nyeri High School, he earned a Bachelor’s in Commerce from the University of Nairobi, followed by postgraduate studies at York University in Canada and Harvard Business School.

He returned home in the early 1970s, as Kenya’s financial sector was still largely controlled by foreign institutions. Hired first at the Ministry of Finance, he joined the team tasked with localizing economic policy and expanding domestic capital markets. By 1974 he was part of the group that helped reconstitute the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)—an institution with only a handful of listed companies at the time.

In 1983, he acquired a controlling stake in Dyer & Blair, one of the city’s oldest brokerage firms. He reorganized it into a modern investment bank, bringing international standards of compliance and underwriting to a market then driven by trust more than transparency. His timing coincided with Kenya’s privatization program in the 1990s, when state-owned enterprises were being listed on the NSE. Dyer & Blair handled some of the largest transactions, including the Kenya Airways IPO (1996) and later the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) listing.

Mbaru’s methods were procedural. He recruited economists, lawyers, and accountants rather than salesmen, introduced performance-based pay, and insisted on independent audits long before regulators required them. His firm became a training ground for much of Kenya’s later financial leadership.

By the early 2000s, he had built a reputation as the intellectual architect of Kenya’s modern capital markets. As chairman of the Nairobi Stock Exchange from 1991 to 2001, he spearheaded reforms that digitized trading, improved disclosure standards, and opened the market to regional investors.

His writings—most notably Transforming Kenya: A Manifesto for Peace, Justice, and Prosperity—combine macroeconomic theory with on-the-ground case studies of privatization and governance. Though he entered politics briefly, running unsuccessfully for the Nairobi governorship in 2013, his influence has remained technocratic rather than electoral.

Colleagues describe his management style as strict but analytical. “He manages by question,” said a former executive. “He’ll ask ten in a row until you know your numbers or you’re gone.”

Today, Dyer & Blair remains one of East Africa’s oldest independent investment banks, managing corporate finance, asset management, and advisory portfolios across Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. Mbaru continues to sit on the boards of major regional companies and is frequently consulted by policymakers drafting financial legislation.

He rarely grants interviews, preferring policy memos and board minutes to press statements. When asked once about his philosophy of wealth, he responded, “Money is not the goal. Order is.”

In a region where markets still rely on personality, Jimnah Mbaru’s career reads as a counterexample: a life spent replacing instinct with systems, and ambition with arithmetic.
