Vimal Shah

Chairman, Bidco Africa

At a processing plant in Thika, just outside Nairobi, conveyor belts hum as cartons of cooking oil roll off an automated line stamped Made in Kenya. On the mezzanine above, Vimal Shah watches the machines through a pane of glass. For three decades, this is how he has preferred to appear—visible in industry, almost invisible in politics.

Born in Nyeri County in the early 1960s, Shah grew up behind the counter of a small family store run by his father, Bhimji Depar Shah, an Indian immigrant who had come to Kenya in the 1950s. The family sold clothes, cooking fat, and sugar to farmers from the slopes of Mount Kenya. For Vimal, it was an education in margins and motion—the speed with which stock moved, the value hidden in repetition.

He attended Nairobi Primary and Highway Secondary School, then graduated from the University of Nairobi with a degree in Business Administration and Finance. His formal training mattered less than what he absorbed at home: that manufacturing, not trading, held the key to long-term control of price and supply.

In the early 1980s, as Kenya’s economy opened to regional trade, Shah joined his father and brother, Tarun, in a decision that would change their fortunes. They moved from garments to soap and edible oils, forming what would become Bidco Industries. The first plant—an improvised structure in Nairobi’s Industrial Area—produced less than five tons a day. Raw materials came by truck from Mombasa; finished bars were cut and wrapped by hand.

Over the next two decades, the company expanded across East Africa, establishing refineries and bottling plants in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Shah oversaw what analysts now describe as one of the continent’s earliest examples of vertical integration—a single firm controlling sourcing, refining, packaging, and distribution. By 2010, Bidco Africa products were in more than a dozen markets, from sunflower oil and detergents to juices and hygiene brands.

Shah’s leadership style mirrored his production lines: efficient, repetitive, deliberate. He delegated rarely and traveled frequently, tracking price movements in palm oil, power, and transport. Former employees say he demanded precision more than deference. “If he asked for a number, you gave him the number, not a story,” recalled a former executive.

In 2012, Shah stepped down as CEO to become chairman, a transition he described as “institutionalizing succession.” The move kept control within the family but opened room for professional management. He also took a broader role in policy, serving as chair of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) and advising the government on industrial policy and youth employment.

Under his tenure, Bidco invested in renewable energy, converting boilers to run on biomass, and launched a research facility focused on local oil-seed farming. Analysts estimate Bidco’s annual turnover at more than $500 million, though the company does not publish full accounts.

Shah’s name has surfaced in political debate—labor disputes, environmental suits, and tax investigations—but none have derailed the business. In interviews, he avoids confrontation, describing himself as “a builder, not a brawler.” Colleagues say his focus remains the same as it was in his father’s shop: growth through consistency.

Now in his early sixties, Vimal Shah spends part of each week in Thika, part on the road across East Africa, monitoring markets and mentoring startups through Bidco Africa’s entrepreneurship programs. In an economy where many industrialists have shifted to real estate or politics, he remains in manufacturing.

From the balcony of the Thika plant, the smell of palm oil drifts through the air. Below, workers in orange helmets load pallets into trucks marked for Kampala. Shah turns to leave, notebook under his arm. “You measure success,” he says quietly, “by what keeps moving.”
