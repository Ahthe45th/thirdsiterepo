Jimnah Mbaru

Economist · Founder of Dyer & Blair Investment Bank

Murang’a, 1947. The Union Jack still flew above schools, and Kenya had no stock exchange to call its own. Jimnah Mbaru was a chief’s son with a scholar’s temperament, fascinated by how numbers govern nations.

After degrees in commerce, law, and an MBA from the University of Nairobi—then advanced training at Harvard—he entered government as an economist, but bureaucracy dulled him. He left to buy a tiny colonial-era brokerage called Dyer & Blair. He turned it into Kenya’s leading investment bank, engine of IPOs and privatizations that opened ownership to ordinary citizens.

He chaired the Nairobi Stock Exchange through modernization and integration, preaching capital markets as the path to African self-reliance. Not always loved, often right. His book The Path to Prosperity reads like a manifesto for homegrown growth. Mbaru’s voice is measured, his impact systemic: he did not just trade shares — he built faith in them.
