Norah Magero

Mechanical Engineer · Co-founder of Drop Access

In the wet green counties of western Kenya, where roads wash out and clinics wait for power that never comes, a child named Norah Magero once wondered why machines served cities better than people.

At Butere Girls she excelled in physics; at Jomo Kenyatta University she earned a degree in mechanical engineering; at Loughborough University she learned to pair design with justice. Her early career was comfortable — consulting, policy, big projects for bigger firms. Then she looked back home and saw need.

In 2018 she co-founded Drop Access to bring renewable energy to off-grid communities. Out of that workshop came Vaccibox — a solar-powered mobile fridge for transporting vaccines to villages beyond the grid. Light and sturdy, it turned roads of dust into corridors of life.

In 2022 the Royal Academy of Engineering named her its Africa Prize winner — the first Kenyan, the first woman. But Norah measures success in fewer infections, not in accolades. Her machines hum quietly where electricity once failed — a sound like justice arriving on time.
