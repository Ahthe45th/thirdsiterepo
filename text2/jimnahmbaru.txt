Jimnah Mbaru

Investment Banker, Economist, Founder of Dyer & Blair Investment Bank

Just after sunrise, the streets around Nairobi’s Westlands business district are still waking up. At the corner of Waiyaki Way, an aging white building carries a name in blue letters: Dyer & Blair Investment Bank. Inside, behind a desk stacked neatly with financial journals, sits Jimnah Mbaru—a man who has spent four decades trying to prove that Kenyan capital markets could stand on their own.

Born in 1947 in Murang’a County, Mbaru grew up in a small rural community that valued order and education. His father, a village chief, insisted on discipline; his mother ran the household with quiet resolve. “There was no space for laziness,” he recalled in a rare interview. “If you didn’t work, you didn’t eat.”

At Kahuhia and later Nyeri High School, he excelled, earning a place at the University of Nairobi to study commerce. He later added degrees in law and business administration, and an Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School. But beneath the credentials lay a simple conviction: Africa’s economic freedom depended on its ability to manage its own capital.

He began his career in government, serving as an economist. It didn’t last. “I wanted to build, not supervise,” he said. In 1983, he bought a small brokerage firm—Dyer & Blair—then a relic of colonial Kenya’s financial infrastructure. From a few desks and telephones, he began reshaping it into a modern investment bank.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, as privatization swept Africa, Mbaru positioned Dyer & Blair at the center of Kenya’s capital markets. His firm led landmark initial public offerings—Kenya Airways, Safaricom, KenGen—introducing ordinary citizens to shareholding in a country where wealth had long been closed off. “He made the stock market matter to the average Kenyan,” said a former colleague.

Mbaru later chaired the Nairobi Stock Exchange and the African Securities Exchanges Association, helping integrate regional trading platforms. His reforms pushed for transparency, automation, and broader participation. He wasn’t always popular. “He could be blunt,” one peer said. “But he was almost always right.”

Beyond finance, Mbaru has published books and policy papers, most notably The Path to Prosperity, a manifesto on African economic sovereignty. He once ran for Nairobi governor, losing narrowly but leaving behind a campaign that emphasized data over slogans. “Politics,” he said afterward, “is another form of investment. You just measure returns differently.”

Today, his office is quiet. The phone rings occasionally; a young analyst brings in reports for review. Mbaru glances at a ticker on his screen, the Nairobi Securities Exchange index shifting slightly. “Markets are like people,” he says. “They need confidence to move forward.”

Outside, the morning traffic thickens, matatus honking past the glass tower that now houses the NSE—an institution he helped modernize. Mbaru leans back, hands clasped. “We built this market from almost nothing,” he says softly. “That’s what I’m proud of. Not the money. The system.”
