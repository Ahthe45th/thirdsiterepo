Dorcas Muthoni

Engineer, Tech Innovator, Founder of Openworld and AfChix

On a weekday morning in Nairobi’s Kilimani district, the hum of generators competes with the chatter of developers in a small co-working space. At one desk, a group of women in hijabs and headwraps stare intently at lines of code projected on a wall. Behind them, in the back of the room, Dorcas Muthoni watches—arms folded, expression measured. “They just need to see someone who looks like them doing this,” she says.

Born in Kenya in the late 1970s, Muthoni grew up in a working-class family that prized curiosity over convention. Her parents couldn’t afford much, but they insisted that their daughter’s questions were never a nuisance. “I was the child who broke radios,” she once joked. “Because I wanted to see what was inside.”

Her public-school education was uneven—frequent teacher strikes, overcrowded classrooms—but she excelled anyway. She earned a place at the University of Nairobi and graduated with a degree in computer science, at a time when few Kenyan women pursued technology at all. It was the late 1990s. The internet was new. Kenya’s tech industry barely existed.

In her early twenties, Muthoni founded Openworld, a software company focused on building reliable systems for governments and NGOs. The work was technical, often bureaucratic, rarely glamorous. But her company earned a reputation for stability and precision. “She had this way of translating complexity into something useful,” said a former client. “She built trust, not hype.”

Still, she saw the gap around her—classrooms and companies with few women, girls who believed computers were “for boys.” In 2004 she started AfChix, a network to mentor and train women in tech across Africa. What began as small weekend sessions in Nairobi grew into a continental movement. The program trained hundreds of women, many of whom now lead data labs, startups, and university programs.

Her approach was patient, methodical. No slogans, no grand gestures—just workshops, mentorship calls, and a growing web of solidarity. “We can’t wait for someone else to include us,” she said in a speech at the Internet Governance Forum. “We have to write our own code—literally.”

Recognition came quietly but steadily. In 2014, she was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame, joining a global roster of digital pioneers. Invitations followed—from the United Nations, from universities abroad—but she stayed in Nairobi. Her focus, she said, was not to escape Africa’s challenges but to help solve them.

Even now, she keeps her office modest—white walls, few decorations, a single photograph of her students celebrating a hackathon win. “That’s my return on investment,” she says, smiling.

As the women in the Kilimani space debug their programs, Muthoni leans over a screen to offer advice. “Try again,” she says gently. The code runs. The error clears. A small victory—one of thousands she has nurtured quietly, reshaping what power in tech looks like, one woman, one line, one program at a time.
