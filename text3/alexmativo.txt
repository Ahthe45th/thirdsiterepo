Alex Mativo

Entrepreneur, Designer, Founder of E-LAB and Nanasi

At a workshop tucked behind a warehouse in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, workers in overalls feed discarded circuit boards into a disassembler that separates metal from plastic. Nearby, a small 3D printer hums as it turns recycled material into jewelry molds. The process looks improvised but isn’t. It’s the foundation of E-LAB, a company founded by Alex Mativo to turn electronic waste into marketable design products.

Born in 1993 in Kenya, Mativo studied Design and Computer Science and came of age during Nairobi’s first wave of digital startups. His instinct, however, leaned toward hardware, not software. After reading reports showing that Kenya generated more than 50,000 tons of e-waste annually, he saw potential in what most firms paid to discard.

He began collecting obsolete electronics from schools and government offices—broken monitors, outdated CPUs, printer cartridges—and stripping them for usable components. What started as a university side project evolved into E-LAB Ltd., a business that manufactures fashion accessories and art pieces from recycled electronic parts.

Mativo describes the firm’s purpose in functional terms: “Reduce waste, create jobs, produce value.” Each piece sold funds more collection, each collection feeds new design runs. By 2018, E-LAB had processed over 20 tons of electronic waste and trained dozens of youth in sustainable design and micro-manufacturing.

His second venture, Nanasi, links African artisans and brands to online customers through a proprietary logistics platform. The startup bridges small-scale producers with the global creative economy, allowing designers to sell without managing shipping or payments infrastructure. It currently supports vendors across Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa, emphasizing ethical sourcing and transparency in the supply chain.

Mativo’s operational model mirrors his generation’s pragmatism—less venture capital, more reinvested revenue. He bootstrapped both firms through client income and strategic partnerships, avoiding dependence on foreign funding. Industry analysts place his combined operations’ valuation in the low millions of dollars, small but profitable.

Recognized by Forbes Africa’s 30 Under 30 and the Queen’s Young Leaders Program, Mativo has spoken at global sustainability conferences from London to Kigali. Yet he remains skeptical of what he calls “panel entrepreneurship”—talking more than building. “Our continent doesn’t need more speeches,” he said in a 2022 interview. “It needs factories.”

His workshops are lean—machines secondhand, software open-source, training continuous. Employees learn machining, digital design, and business accounting before managing their own projects. The system has turned the workshop into a quiet prototype for circular manufacturing in Africa’s urban centers.

Observers credit Mativo with connecting three rarely aligned sectors: technology, art, and waste management. His approach has drawn pilot partnerships with development agencies studying scalable recycling for electronics, a fast-growing global environmental challenge.

In person, he speaks more like an engineer than a founder. There are no slogans, just numbers—kilograms recovered, units sold, hours worked. He insists sustainability must “survive audit.”

As global firms shift toward net-zero supply chains, Mativo’s model offers a local blueprint—industrial in method, cultural in output.

Inside the workshop, a finished necklace made from a recycled hard-drive disk is laid beside a shipment tag marked for export. For Mativo, the object is less artwork than data point: one less piece of e-waste in a landfill, one more Kenyan product in a global market.
