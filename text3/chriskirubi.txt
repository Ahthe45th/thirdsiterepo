Chris Kirubi

Industrialist, Investor, Media Executive

At the corner office of International Life House in Nairobi, sunlight once fell across a wall of screens tuned to business news. There, until his death in 2021, Chris Kirubi ran his empire the same way he built it—by watching, measuring, and moving early.

Born in 1941 in Nairobi, when Kenya was still under British rule, Kirubi grew up poor and orphaned. Relatives took him in, but by adolescence he was working odd jobs: selling newspapers, running errands, fixing bicycles. Formal schooling ended early. What replaced it was pattern recognition—how goods, labor, and risk moved through a city that barely functioned for Africans.

After independence, he joined Shell as a sales trainee and later studied business in Germany, absorbing the reconstruction ethic of postwar Europe: repair, reuse, rebuild. When he returned home, Nairobi was beginning to privatize land and industry. Kirubi saw what few others did—that urban decay could become collateral.

In the 1970s, he began buying derelict buildings in the city center, renovating them, and flipping them for profit. The formula—low purchase price, efficient renovation, high rental yield—became the seed of his real-estate portfolio. By the mid-1980s, he had moved into manufacturing, acquiring Haco Industries, then a small local assembler of consumer goods. He expanded production into cosmetics, plastics, and household items, later partnering with multinational brands such as BIC and Tiger Brands.

Kirubi diversified aggressively. Through Centum Investment Company, where he became the largest individual shareholder and later chairman, he financed infrastructure, power, and retail projects. He described investment as “a blood sport”—not metaphor, but arithmetic. “If the numbers make sense,” he told Business Daily in 2018, “you move. If they don’t, you walk.”

His ventures mirrored Kenya’s own economic liberalization. As foreign investors returned in the 1990s, Kirubi became a bridge—fluent in boardroom English and street Swahili, comfortable negotiating both government licenses and corporate mergers. His style was visible and direct. He wore Italian suits, drove German cars, and used social media to promote entrepreneurship under the nickname DJ CK.

In 1999, he purchased Capital FM, a struggling radio station, turning it into Kenya’s leading urban broadcaster. The outlet doubled as a marketing channel for his portfolio and a recruitment base for young professionals. “He believed influence was as important as inventory,” said one former manager.

Diagnosed with cancer in 2017, Kirubi continued to run operations until the final months of his life. He served on numerous boards and was awarded the Moran of the Order of the Burning Spear, one of Kenya’s highest civilian honors.

By the time of his death in June 2021, analysts valued his holdings—real estate, manufacturing, media, and equities—at several hundred million dollars. His estate remains under consolidation.

Critics often described him as blunt, transactional, even abrasive. Admirers called him the embodiment of post-independence capitalism: an orphan who turned Nairobi’s uncertainty into leverage. Both views can be true.

In the end, Kirubi’s career traced the arc of Kenya’s private sector—from scarcity to speculation to scale. The skyline he once rebuilt now carries the mark of his bets: towers that rose where others saw risk.
