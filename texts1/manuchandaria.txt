Manu Chandaria

Industrialist and Philanthropist, Chairman of Comcraft Group

In colonial Nairobi of 1929, the streets still carried dust from ox carts and the orders of empire.  Into that hierarchy was born Manu Chandaria, the son of an Indian shopkeeper and a mother who measured wealth in virtue, not volume.

He studied first in local schools, then crossed continents — engineering in Pune, then Oklahoma University, absorbing precision, discipline, and a conviction that knowledge was a form of service.  He could have stayed abroad.  He came home instead, to a Kenya still in chains, to help his family’s tiny aluminum workshop survive.

From that furnace emerged Comcraft Group, a network of steel and aluminum factories that would eventually span more than fifty countries.  The company roofed post-independence Africa — its sheets gleaming on homes from Lagos to Lusaka.

Yet Chandaria’s wealth never loosened his restraint.  A devout Jain, he lived by the doctrine that possession without purpose is waste.  Through the Chandaria Foundation, he endowed hospitals, schools, and peace centers.  He gave quietly, consistently, until his generosity became infrastructure.

Honored with the OBE and the EBS, he shrugs off ceremony.  “Wealth is not yours to keep,” he often says.  “It is yours to share.”  In a century of excess, he built a gentler empire — one that measured return in lives improved.
