Dr. Eddah Gachukia

Educator, Feminist, Founder of Riara Group of Schools

On a weekday morning, the assembly bell rings at Riara Group of Schools in Nairobi. Children in neat uniforms spill into the courtyard, reciting verses and songs about diligence and kindness. Watching from a balcony above, Dr. Eddah Gachukia smiles faintly. “Education,” she says, “is how we build our future without shouting.”

Born in 1936 in Central Kenya, Eddah Wanjiru Gachukia grew up under colonial rule, where classrooms were scarce for African girls and expectations lower still. Her father was a teacher, her mother a homemaker. Books were rare, but ambition was not. “My parents believed learning was the one inheritance that couldn’t be stolen,” she recalled.

She attended Alliance Girls’ High School—one of the first Kenyan women to do so—and later earned a Bachelor’s degree in Education from Makerere University. A scholarship took her to Leeds University in the United Kingdom for postgraduate studies. It was the late 1950s, and the Mau Mau uprising raged at home. “We were studying freedom from afar,” she said in an interview.

Returning to a newly independent Kenya, she joined the University of Nairobi as a lecturer in the 1960s, teaching English and literature. She rose quickly, becoming one of the few women in leadership at the university. But she soon realized that teaching alone was not enough. “We needed systems that empowered girls from the ground up,” she said.

In 1974, she co-founded the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE), which would go on to shape gender policy across the continent. Through research and advocacy, FAWE fought for girls’ access to education, challenging early marriage, classroom bias, and economic barriers. Her advocacy reached policymakers and village chiefs alike. “You don’t transform nations by issuing memos,” she said. “You do it by opening doors.”

Two decades later, alongside her husband Daniel, she established the Riara Group of Schools, beginning with a small kindergarten in their home compound. The name Riara—borrowed from a nearby river—symbolized growth and continuity. Over time, that modest school expanded into a network of institutions, from primary to university, serving thousands of students each year.

At 89, Gachukia still walks the corridors, stopping to greet teachers and students by name. Her presence is calm but unmistakable. “She doesn’t need to raise her voice,” one teacher says. “Her eyes do the talking.”

Her philosophy blends structure with empathy. Classrooms at Riara emphasize curiosity over rote learning, dialogue over deference. “I want our children to know,” she says, “that excellence and kindness are not opposites.”

She has received national honors, honorary doctorates, and international recognition for her work, but in her office, the walls hold only family photos and student art. “These are my legacy,” she says, gesturing at a crayon drawing taped to her cabinet.

As the morning assembly disperses, a group of girls runs past, clutching books and laughing. Gachukia watches them go, a hand resting on the railing. “When I see them,” she says softly, “I see everything we fought for.”
