Narendra Raval ( “Guru” )

Founder and Chairman, Devki Group

Before the clang of steel, there was silence.  In Gujarat, India, a boy of eleven knelt before an idol and took vows of priesthood.  He was named Narendra Raval and ordained a Swaminarayan monk — trained in austerity, not ambition.

Fate moved him east.  Posted to Kenya to serve in a Nairobi temple, he swept floors and recited scripture.  Outside, the city pulsed with commerce.  Inside, devotion met doubt.  Hunger has a way of rewriting destiny.  Raval left the monastery quietly, traded saffron robes for overalls, and entered a steel workshop in Gikomba Market.

He welded.  He watched.  He learned the chemistry of heat and metal.  By his twenties he owned a hardware stall.  By his thirties, a small rolling mill.  By his forties, the nucleus of what would become Devki Group — an industrial spine producing steel, cement, and roofing for half the region.  Factories rose in Athi River, Ruiru, Tororo, and beyond.

His workers call him “Guru,” half in jest, half in reverence.  The monk in him never vanished.  He still prays before meetings.  He still gives more than he keeps — donating hospitals oxygen, funding schools, building temples.  Yet his humility hides a strategist’s edge.  He prices lower than competitors, sources locally, integrates vertically.  His fortune now counts in hundreds of millions, but his words remain spare: “Serve the country, and the country serves you.”

In him, Kenya found the rare bridge between piety and production.  A man who proved that faith and enterprise can share the same forge.
