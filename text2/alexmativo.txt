Alex Mativo

Tech Entrepreneur, Founder of E-LAB and DABD

In a small workshop tucked behind Nairobi’s Ngong Road, soldering irons buzz and the scent of burnt metal lingers in the air. On a workbench, a designer arranges pieces of old circuit boards—greens and silvers from discarded computers—into a necklace. Watching from the doorway, Alex Mativo smiles. “This,” he says, “is what innovation looks like when you don’t have much to waste.”

Born in 1993 in Nairobi, Mativo grew up in a middle-income household where discipline mattered more than money. His parents insisted on curiosity, on using his hands as much as his mind. At Strathmore School, he developed a taste for both structure and experimentation. Teachers remember him as restless but sharp, the student who finished assignments early so he could tinker with whatever electronics were broken.

He went on to study Information Technology at Strathmore University, where the gap between Kenya’s growing tech optimism and its mounting electronic waste became impossible to ignore. “Every innovation leaves a trail,” he said in an early TED-style talk. “I wanted to see what we could make of the leftovers.”

In 2013, at just 20, Mativo founded E-LAB, an e-waste recycling company. His vision was simple but unconventional: take discarded electronics, extract reusable materials, and transform them into design and art pieces. Soon, his collaborations with local artisans produced handbags, jewelry, and installations made from circuit boards and wiring. It was recycling, reimagined.

His next venture, DABD—Digital Africa Branding Design—grew out of the same impulse: helping small African businesses present themselves with global polish without losing local identity. Through DABD, Mativo and his team have designed branding and digital content for more than a hundred enterprises across the continent.

Recognition came quickly. In his early twenties, Mativo was named a UNESCO Youth Ambassador for Peace, a Queen’s Young Leader, and a Laureate Global Fellow. His work appeared on CNN, Forbes, and Al Jazeera. But when asked about success, he brushes it off. “Awards don’t build systems,” he says. “People do.”

At his current studio, stacked with half-dismantled monitors and crates of metal scrap, Mativo’s routine is as grounded as his ideas. He starts each day sorting through e-waste collected from Nairobi’s markets, deciding which pieces can be reused and which will be stripped down for parts. “Every item here,” he says, “was once considered useless.”

His projects now straddle art, design, and environmental advocacy, proving that sustainability in Africa doesn’t have to imitate the West—it can invent its own form. He describes his mission as “making waste aspirational,” and pauses before adding, “because if we can change how people see trash, we can change how they see possibility.”

Outside, young apprentices wheel in a new load of obsolete printers. The sound of metal against concrete fills the air. For Mativo, it’s the music of transformation—an anthem for a generation making beauty, and business, from the discarded edges of a digital world.
