Bhimji Depar Shah

Founder, Bidco Group

He came to Kenya without ceremony — just the hum of an engine and the smell of sea salt at Mombasa port.  It was the 1950s, and Bhimji Depar Shah, born in India’s dust-choked towns, carried little more than a merchant’s instinct and a hunger to begin.

Nyeri became his ground.  There he opened a tiny shop selling fabric and household goods to farmers who paid in patience.  The business was modest, but it taught him rhythm — of supply, demand, and trust.  From those ledgers grew an idea: that Africans could manufacture what they consumed.

In the 1980s he turned that conviction into Bidco Industries, first stitching garments, then pressing oil, then boiling soap.  He fought for market share in a field ruled by multinationals, hedging ambition with thrift, vision with vigilance.  There were shortages, strikes, currency tremors.  Still he built — brick by cautious brick.

He never studied at Harvard.  His MBA was the factory floor.  He negotiated with drivers and bankers the same way he once bargained for cloth — firmly, fairly, finally.  Under his gaze Bidco became continental: edible oils, detergents, beverages, logistics networks stretching from Thika to Kampala.  His philosophy was blunt — own the chain, master the margin.

By the mid-2000s he was counted among Kenya’s richest men, though he wore his wealth lightly.  While others performed prosperity, Bhimji kept working hours that mocked retirement.  He left the limelight to his son Vimal but remained the company’s moral ledger — the one who reminded everyone where it began.

He did not inherit empire; he assembled it.  His life’s proof was simple and Kenyan: that you can build enduring power not by extraction, but by creation.
