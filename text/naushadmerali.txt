Naushad Merali

Founder, Sameer Group

In the marble lobby of Nairobi’s Sameer Business Park, a bronze plaque lists the companies once housed here—banks, telecom firms, manufacturers. Few bear the founder’s name, but all trace back to Naushad Merali, a man whose power lay in timing more than volume.

Born on January 1, 1951, in Nairobi, Merali grew up in a middle-class Ismaili family that prized education and discretion. His father ran a modest trading business; his mother managed the household with quiet precision. That equilibrium—discipline over display—would shape his career.

He attended Highway Secondary School before training as an accountant in the United Kingdom, where he absorbed the post-imperial culture of documentation and audit. When he returned to Kenya in the early 1970s, he joined a local finance firm as a clerk. The economy was opening, and new policy allowed Africans and Asians to acquire businesses abandoned by departing colonial owners.

His first big move came when he bought a stake in Ryce Motors, a small vehicle dealership. He streamlined operations, renegotiated supply contracts, and built a distribution chain that eventually attracted Japanese partners. It became a textbook example of what he would repeat for the next four decades: find an underperforming asset, impose efficiency, and exit at scale.

By the 1980s he had founded Sameer Group, a holding company spanning finance, construction, agriculture, and technology. The group’s portfolio eventually included Yana Tyres, Sasini Tea & Coffee, and Sameer Business Park—assets valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Merali insisted on local ownership but operated with global partners, bringing in investors from Japan’s Yokohama Rubber and France’s Alcatel at a time when Kenya was largely cut off from foreign direct investment.

His defining moment came in 2004. As a shareholder in mobile operator Kencell, Merali orchestrated a rapid sale of his stake to Celtel International for more than $20 million—executed within hours of the parent company’s own acquisition announcement. The precision of that deal turned him into a legend in Nairobi’s boardrooms and a case study in transactional agility.

Unlike most of his peers, Merali avoided the spotlight. He kept no public relations team, granted few interviews, and appeared rarely in politics. Associates describe him as “a calculator in motion”—soft-spoken, analytic, rarely spontaneous. He preferred handwritten notes to email and demanded verification on every figure before signing.

Through the Zarina and Naushad Merali Foundation, he funded hospitals, schools, and programs for people with disabilities. Donations were documented but never advertised. His family’s projects included clinics in Nairobi’s low-income estates and scholarships at the Aga Khan University.

For his contributions to industry and philanthropy, he received the Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear (CBS), one of Kenya’s highest honors. Even so, his name remained absent from public ceremonies.

Merali died in July 2021 at 70. His passing went almost unmarked outside business circles, yet the companies he founded remain integral to Kenya’s private-sector architecture.

Colleagues recall that he measured every decision against two questions: What is the downside? What is the timing? In a country where fortunes often hinge on proximity to power, Naushad Merali proved that mastery of timing could be a power of its own.
