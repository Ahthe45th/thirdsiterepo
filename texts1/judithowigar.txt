Judith Owigar

Technologist · Co-founder of AkiraChix

She was born in Nairobi in 1987, when computers were rarer than paved roads in many towns. For most girls, the machine was a closed door. Judith Owigar knocked until it opened.

Raised in a family of discipline and devotion, she learned that faith without effort is idleness. At St. George’s Girls she found the language of code. At the University of Nairobi, she made it her dialect. After graduation she worked as a systems analyst—often the only woman in the room, surrounded by men who spoke about technology as though it were inheritance, not knowledge.

In 2010 she co-founded AkiraChix, a training ground for women in tech across East Africa. They taught code and confidence in equal measure, turning classrooms into incubators of possibility. Hundreds graduated; dozens founded start-ups; many now teach others.

Judith became a Google Anita Borg Scholar, a TechWomen Fellow, a symbol of what happens when access meets audacity. She still speaks softly, but her work shouts across a continent: African women are not waiting to be invited into the digital future—they are writing its code.
