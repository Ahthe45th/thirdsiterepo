Bhimji Depar Shah

Founder, Bidco Group

On a humid afternoon in Thika, the oldest workers at Bidco’s oil refinery still mention the founder in the present tense. Bhimji Depar Shah, they say, built the company the way he built his life—quietly, piece by piece, never faster than cash flow allowed.

Born in 1931 in India, Bhimji grew up in a merchant family accustomed to shortages and small gains. In the 1950s, as colonial East Africa opened to Asian migration, he boarded a steamer for Mombasa carrying little beyond trade licenses and letters of introduction. He settled in Nyeri, a provincial town then run on trust and paper ledgers, and opened a general store selling clothes, salt, and soap to farmers who paid in cash or produce.

He kept meticulous accounts. By the 1970s, the shop had become a modest distribution hub, linking Nairobi wholesalers with rural retailers. But Bhimji wanted control over production. In the early 1980s, he shifted from retail to manufacturing—an uncommon leap for local businessmen of Indian descent who typically avoided Kenya’s industrial sector dominated by colonial-era firms.

The first Bidco Industries workshop produced garments. When imports flooded the market, Bhimji pivoted to soap and cooking fat—products Kenyans used daily, made from raw materials that could be sourced locally. He ran the factory with his sons, Vimal and Tarun, insisting that every shilling be justified. Former staff recall him touring the floor in a short-sleeved shirt, stopwatch in hand, timing production cycles and fuel use.

The company’s turning point came when it began refining edible oils. By internalizing the entire process—from crude-palm import to packaging—Bidco cut dependency on multinationals and established one of the region’s earliest vertically integrated consumer-goods chains. As demand expanded through the 1990s, the Shah family reinvested profits into machinery and distribution depots instead of dividends.

By the mid-2000s, Bidco products such as Kimbo, Elianto, and Powerboy had become staples across East Africa. Industry analysts credit Bhimji’s decision to build full supply chains for insulating the company from the corruption and foreign-exchange shocks that crippled competitors. His instinct was to grow in real assets—plants, trucks, warehouses—rather than speculative ventures.

Though his son Vimal became the company’s public face, insiders say Bhimji remained its final authority. He kept to a strict schedule, refused credit, and demanded written approvals for every purchase. When profits surged, he added a clause to the family charter requiring a percentage be reinvested into local farming partnerships—a move that linked factory output to Kenyan oil-seed production.

In 2007, Forbes estimated his fortune at over $700 million, placing him among Kenya’s wealthiest men. Yet there were no press interviews, no lavish homes beyond necessity. He preferred boardrooms to banquets, numbers to ceremony.

Now in his nineties, largely retired from public life, Bhimji Depar Shah remains a reference point in East Africa’s manufacturing history: an immigrant trader who proved that an African firm could compete with global suppliers on efficiency, not subsidy.

Inside the Thika headquarters, a small portrait of him hangs near the reception desk. Below it, in simple brass letters, a line reads: “Built to Last. Built in Kenya.”
