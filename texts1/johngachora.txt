John Gachora

Group Managing Director · CEO of NCBA Bank

In Kiambu’s rolling hills of the 1970s, discipline was a household ritual. John Gachora grew up within it—books balanced with chores, ambition tempered by grace. At Alliance High School he stood out for quiet excellence. MIT took him next, then Wharton. From those corridors of precision he learned that money is language, and integrity its grammar.

He worked on Wall Street and in Johannesburg, calculating risk for empires that would never see Kiambu. Then he came home. In 2013 he took over NIC Bank and merged it with Commercial Bank of Africa to form NCBA — a regional giant with local heartbeat. He expanded digital credit through M-Shwari and drove profits without pomposity.

His leadership is measured, his language moderate, his results precise. Under him NCBA grew in customers and confidence. He shows that global training can serve national purpose — and that in banking, as in life, trust remains the strongest currency.
