Narendra Raval (Guru)

Founder and Chairman, Devki Group

On a weekday morning in Athi River, the clang of metal rises above the roar of furnaces. Workers in heatproof suits feed scrap steel into a glowing vat, sparks scattering like fireworks across the factory floor. From an elevated walkway, industrialist Narendra Raval watches quietly, a notebook in hand. “Steel is a living thing,” he says. “It teaches patience.”

Raval, 62, grew up worlds away from this industrial sprawl. Born in Gujarat, India, he was raised within the Swaminarayan temple, a Hindu order built on service and restraint. At age eleven he was ordained a priest. For years he swept temple floors, recited scripture, and ate only what was given in alms. He thought that would be his life. Then came a posting to Kenya, a temple assignment that would alter his path entirely.

Nairobi in the late 1970s was expanding, its markets bustling with traders from across the region. Raval worked in the temple by day and wandered the industrial areas by night, drawn to the mechanics of welding shops and construction sites. When he left the priesthood, he carried little more than curiosity.

His first job was as a welder in Gikomba, a crowded neighborhood where the city’s informal industries thrived. He earned just enough to survive but watched closely—how prices were set, how materials moved, how small efficiencies made large profits. With his wife, Neeta, he opened a hardware stall. The business grew steadily, supplying roofing sheets and steel bars to Nairobi’s building boom.

In 1986 he registered Devki Steel Mills, the first link in what would become the Devki Group—a regional manufacturer producing steel, cement, and roofing materials for Kenya, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. His factories now employ thousands and provide much of the raw material that shapes East Africa’s infrastructure.

Despite his vast holdings, Raval’s habits remain monastic. He rises before dawn to pray. He drives himself to work. At company gatherings, employees address him as “Guru,” a nickname that stuck from his temple days. “You can leave the temple,” he told one journalist, “but not the discipline.”

His approach to business is both spiritual and strategic: local sourcing, fair pricing, vertical integration. During the pandemic he donated oxygen cylinders to hospitals across Kenya. He funds scholarships and builds temples, often without publicity. In 2018 the government recognized him with the Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear, one of the country’s highest civilian honors.

Asked once how a former priest became an industrial magnate, he smiled. “The same way you make steel,” he said. “You pass through fire. You don’t complain. You come out stronger.”

At Athi River, molten metal flows down the casting line, cooling into long, gleaming bars. Raval watches as they harden. Faith and fire, fused into something permanent.
