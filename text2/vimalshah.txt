Vimal Shah

Chairman, Bidco Africa

On a gray morning in Thika, the scent of palm oil drifts from steel vats as forklifts hum through Bidco Africa’s industrial compound. Workers in blue overalls move between drums of detergent and cartons of cooking oil bound for supermarkets across East Africa. At the edge of the factory floor, chairman Vimal Shah watches a conveyor belt slide into motion—a ritual that, for him, never lost its meaning.

Shah, 63, grew up far from this sprawl of pipes and smoke. His father, Bhimji Depar Shah, migrated from India in the 1950s and opened a small clothing shop in Nyeri, a quiet town in Kenya’s central highlands. The family lived behind the store. Coins were counted by lamplight. From those evenings, Vimal learned what would become his lifelong rule: business is built, not inherited.

He attended Nairobi Primary and Highway Secondary School, then studied business administration at the University of Nairobi. In the early 1980s, as Kenya’s economy loosened and a small middle class began demanding locally made goods, he and his brother Tarun joined their father in a modest factory. The Shahs started with soap—an item small enough to risk, essential enough to sell.

Bidco’s early years were precarious: erratic power supply, import competition, and scarce credit. But the family persisted, reinvesting every shilling. By the late 1990s, their brands—Kimbo, Elianto, Powerboy—had become household names. Today Bidco produces edible oils, beverages, and hygiene products for a region of more than 300 million people.

Shah speaks often about integration and efficiency, but rarely about himself. Colleagues describe him as methodical, unhurried, and almost ascetic in his routine. Under his direction, the company moved into renewable energy, expanded to Uganda and Tanzania, and introduced research programs aimed at using local crops. “If we don’t innovate here,” he told a business forum recently, “someone else will—probably from outside Africa.”

In 2012 he stepped aside as chief executive, taking the chairman’s role to make space for new management. The decision, he said, was about continuity. Beyond Bidco, he has chaired the Kenya Private Sector Alliance and mentored young entrepreneurs through regional programs.

His influence is visible in factories and boardrooms, but also in how Kenyan industry views itself—less as a colonial appendage, more as a continental engine. Critics point to Bidco’s labor disputes and environmental controversies; supporters credit it with proving that large-scale manufacturing can be African-owned. Shah rarely responds publicly, preferring to let expansion charts and employment figures speak.

On most days he arrives early, walking the plant before meetings begin. The machines roar, oil gleams under fluorescent light, and workers nod as he passes. “We started with nothing,” he says quietly. “We just decided to make something that lasts.”
