Manu Chandaria

Industrialist, Philanthropist, Chairman of Comcraft Group

In a boardroom overlooking Nairobi’s industrial belt, Manu Chandaria sits beside a stack of manila folders marked Education, Health, Steel. The categories mirror the architecture of his life: business, philanthropy, and order. At ninety-six, he still keeps the same schedule—office by 7 a.m., meetings until noon, no deviations.

Born in 1929 in Nairobi, when it was still a segregated colonial outpost, Chandaria grew up above his father’s corner shop on Biashara Street. His family, recent immigrants from India’s Gujarat region, traded provisions and scrap metal. Profit was meager, but the culture of thrift and reinvestment took hold early.

He studied at the Government Indian School (now Jamhuri High), then at the University of Pune in India, earning an engineering degree before winning a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma for a master’s in engineering. He graduated into post-war America’s boom years, when factories ran 24 hours a day. Colleagues urged him to stay. Instead, he came home to a colony still under British rule.

Back in Nairobi in the 1950s, he joined his family’s small aluminum-ware shop. As independence approached, Chandaria saw opportunity in local demand for construction materials. He expanded the business into Comcraft Group, an integrated network producing steel, aluminum, and plastics across more than 50 countries. The firm became one of Africa’s earliest home-grown multinationals, exporting roofing sheets and steel tubing from Nairobi to Lagos, Kampala, and Accra.

The model was straightforward: manufacture locally, reinvest profits, and partner with governments hungry for post-colonial infrastructure. Comcraft’s revenues have long been privately held, but industry analysts estimate annual turnover in the billions of dollars. The group’s operations helped anchor Kenya’s industrial sector through the 1970s and 1980s, when many investors fled under political instability.

Chandaria’s management style reflects his Jain faith—methodical, restrained, and rooted in non-violence. He rarely raises his voice, travels economy class on short flights, and keeps detailed ledgers by hand. “Wealth,” he often says, “is a responsibility, not a right.”

That ethos shaped the Chandaria Foundation, one of East Africa’s oldest family-run philanthropic trusts. The foundation funds hospitals, university research centers, and peace initiatives, including endowments at Strathmore University and the Aga Khan Hospital. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it supplied medical equipment to several public hospitals without announcing the donations.

Recognition has followed, though he treats it as logistics rather than legacy. Chandaria holds the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and Kenya’s Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear (EBS), along with multiple honorary doctorates. None hang in his office.

In conversation, he returns repeatedly to one principle: structure. “If you cannot account for a shilling,” he told a young executive recently, “you should not handle a million.”

Outside his headquarters, the city hums with speculative real-estate towers and quick-turn startups. Chandaria’s empire, by contrast, remains anchored in manufacturing—the slow, deliberate craft of turning raw metal into usable form.

He has outlasted regimes, recessions, and rivals. His fortune, still largely unpublicized, is matched only by his insistence on restraint. “We were traders,” he says. “Then we became builders. Now, we must be caretakers.”
