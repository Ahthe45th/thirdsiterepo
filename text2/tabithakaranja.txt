Tabitha Karanja

Founder and Chief Executive, Keroche Breweries

At mid-morning in Naivasha, the stainless-steel fermenters at Keroche Breweries hiss with vapor.  Forklifts rattle across the concrete floor, stacking crates stamped Summit Lager.  From a glass-walled office above the plant, Tabitha Karanja watches the gauges.  “Every batch,” she says, “still feels like the first one we brewed.”

Two decades ago, the idea that a Kenyan-owned company could challenge a global drinks giant sounded reckless.  When Karanja launched Keroche in 1997, Kenya’s alcohol market was dominated by a single multinational and a century of habit.  “We were told, ‘It can’t be done,’” she recalls.  “That was enough reason to try.”

Born in 1964 in Nakuru County, she grew up near Lake Naivasha in a family that prized education but had little margin for risk.  After studying business administration and accounting, she joined the Ministry of Tourism as a clerk—a stable path that promised little change.  Marriage to Joseph Karanja, a businessman and former brewer, nudged her toward entrepreneurship.  They opened a small hardware store, but profits were thin and competition relentless.  Tabitha noticed something else: locally produced, affordable alcohol was missing from the shelves.

She began blending fortified wines in a single-room workshop behind the shop, using basic equipment and savings from their hardware trade.  The early customers were small bars and traders ignored by the major distributors.  Sales grew quickly—and so did scrutiny.  Legislators raised taxes; competitors questioned her methods.  “Sometimes,” she says, “the hardest part is being the first.”

In 2007 she pivoted to beer production, investing heavily in modern machinery and hiring local technicians.  The new brand, Summit Lager, rolled off the line into a market still skeptical that a homegrown brewery could match imported taste.  Within years, Keroche was shipping across the country and employing hundreds.

Her rise was not without friction.  The company faced protracted battles over excise duty and regulatory approvals.  Critics accused it of defiance; supporters called it determination.  Karanja appeared regularly before cameras, calm but firm, arguing that fair competition—not protection—was all she wanted.  “We don’t need favors,” she said during one press briefing.  “We just need space to grow.”

In 2022, voters in Nakuru County elected her to the Senate, where she now pushes for policies supporting local manufacturers and women-led enterprises.  In interviews, she still describes herself as “a brewer before a politician.”

Inside the Naivasha plant, workers pack cases for shipment as afternoon light spills through the high windows.  The rhythm is steady, almost musical—the sound of a Kenyan industry she insisted could exist.  “I wanted to prove we can make world-class products here,” she says, looking toward the rows of stainless tanks.  “We just needed courage.  And maybe a little stubbornness.”
