Mubarak Muyika

Tech Entrepreneur, Founder of Zagace and Hype Century

In a small Nairobi office, the hum of computers blends with the soft clatter of keyboards. On the wall hangs a whiteboard covered in diagrams of code architecture and handwritten notes—part business plan, part manifesto. At its center stands a young man in a dark hoodie and quiet confidence. “We were taught to survive,” he says. “But I wanted to build.”

Mubarak Muyika was born in 1994 in western Kenya, the last of three children. His father, a civil servant, and his mother, a teacher, both died before he turned twelve. The loss left him orphaned and adrift in a society that rarely expects much of its orphans. Relatives took him in, but even then, resources were thin. Books were shared. School fees were a constant negotiation.

At Friends School Kamusinga, a provincial high school, Muyika discovered computers. The school’s lab was small and outdated, but for him it was a portal. He spent late afternoons repairing old machines and teaching himself to code. At sixteen, he built a content management system to help manage his guardians’ publishing business. The program worked better than anything they had used before.

That first success turned into momentum. In 2010, while still in his teens, Muyika founded Hype Century Technologies, a company providing web hosting and domain registration services. He operated from cyber cafés and borrowed laptops, hustling to sign clients. Within two years, the company had hundreds of customers across East Africa. In 2012, he sold it to a local investor, using the profits to launch something bigger.

Zagace, his second venture, was built to solve a problem many African businesses faced: managing operations without expensive imported software. The platform integrated accounting, HR, inventory, and communication tools in one cloud-based system. Affordable. Scalable. Local. “I wanted to make something that actually fits how we work here,” he said in a 2015 interview.

That same year, Forbes named him one of Africa’s most promising young entrepreneurs. Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group took notice. So did Silicon Valley. But Muyika was careful not to lose the independence that defined his journey. He turned down early offers that would have ceded control. “You can take foreign money,” he told another Kenyan founder, “just don’t sell your dream with it.”

Today, Zagace operates quietly but steadily, its software used by small and mid-sized firms across multiple African markets. Muyika has kept a low profile, avoiding the self-promotion that often follows tech success. Those who know him describe a disciplined, focused leader who prefers code to cameras. “He’s serious,” one colleague said. “He believes the work should speak first.”

In a continent where opportunity often favors the well-connected, his story resonates—a boy who lost everything and built something from code, persistence, and faith in what could come next. “I don’t see myself as a genius,” he said once. “Just someone who refused to stay where life left me.”

In his office, the whiteboard has new diagrams now—plans for expansion, notes on machine learning, a few lines underlined in red: Keep building. Keep local. Keep real.
