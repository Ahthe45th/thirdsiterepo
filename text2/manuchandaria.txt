Manu Chandaria

Industrialist, Philanthropist, Chairman of Comcraft Group

On a weekday afternoon, sunlight glints off sheets of corrugated metal at a Comcraft plant outside Nairobi. The air smells faintly of oil and hot steel. Inside, workers in blue overalls maneuver rolls of aluminum toward cutting machines, the rhythm steady and unhurried. Watching from a quiet corner office is 95-year-old Manu Chandaria—thin, bespectacled, and still taking notes in a small spiral pad. “When you stop being curious,” he says softly, “you stop being useful.”

Born in Nairobi in 1929 to Indian immigrants, Chandaria grew up in a city still divided by race and ruled by empire. His father ran a provisions shop and a scrap metal business, small enterprises that demanded early mornings and long memory. “We learned thrift before we learned arithmetic,” Chandaria has said.

He attended the Government Indian School—now Jamhuri High—and later traveled to India, earning an engineering degree from the University of Pune. A master’s from the University of Oklahoma followed. In postwar America, he saw the scale of industrial ambition, but also the quiet decency of systems that worked. Many of his peers stayed abroad. Chandaria came home.

Kenya, then on the brink of independence, offered neither certainty nor comfort to entrepreneurs of Asian descent. Still, Chandaria joined the family’s aluminum workshop and began to expand it, piece by piece, into a network of manufacturing plants. The work was physical, the margins thin. “There were no shortcuts,” he said. “You build capacity the way you build character—slowly.”

Over decades, that modest enterprise grew into Comcraft Group, a multinational with operations in more than 50 countries. Its steel and aluminum products line homes, hospitals, and schools across Africa. Yet Chandaria rarely speaks of scale. He speaks of stewardship.

A devout Jain, his mornings begin with meditation and end with planning. Wealth, he often reminds younger executives, is only borrowed from society. Through the Chandaria Foundation, he has funded hospitals, scholarships, peace centers, and universities—including Strathmore and the United States International University-Africa. “We can’t eat money,” he told students during a lecture. “But we can use it to feed minds.”

He has been awarded the Order of the British Empire, the Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear, and multiple honorary doctorates. The honors decorate his walls; they do not define him. In interviews, he returns to one line: “Wealth is not yours to keep. It is yours to share.”

At the factory gates, trucks rumble out carrying steel beams toward new buildings. Chandaria stands by the window, watching as they disappear down the road. For a moment, he seems less an industrialist than a custodian—one who believes that the truest measure of success is not what you make, but what you give back.
