Narendra Raval (Guru)

Founder and Chairman, Devki Group

On the factory floor of National Cement in Athi River, the air smells of limestone dust and diesel. Conveyor belts feed crushed rock into the kiln as engineers in helmets track output on handheld screens. At the far end of the plant, Narendra Raval stands near a stack of steel rebar, greeting supervisors by name. He built all of this—from the pipes to the payroll—out of what began as a roadside welding job in Nairobi.

Raval was born in 1962 in Gujarat, India, and raised inside the discipline of the Swaminarayan temple. By age 11 he had taken vows as a Hindu priest. His duties were simple: sweep the floor, light the lamps, memorize scripture. When the temple sent him to Kenya as a teenage assistant, he arrived in a country still balancing its post-colonial economy with imported machinery and foreign ownership.

He left the priesthood in his late teens, traded robes for overalls, and found work at a small steel shop in Gikomba Market—the rough heart of Nairobi’s informal industry. The pay was low, but the exposure was priceless. He learned welding, procurement, and price negotiation from scrap-metal traders who survived on efficiency and instinct.

By the late 1980s, Raval and his wife, Neeta, opened a small hardware store selling roofing sheets. When suppliers raised prices faster than customers could pay, he decided to manufacture the materials himself. That pivot produced Devki Steel Mills, the first link in what would become Devki Group—a vertically integrated industrial network now spanning cement, steel, and roofing production across Kenya, Uganda, and the DRC.

The business model was straightforward: control supply, cut imports, and reinvest profits into new capacity. Devki’s brands—Maisha Mabati, Simba Cement, National Cement—are now embedded in nearly every major construction project in East Africa. Analysts estimate annual turnover in the hundreds of millions of dollars, though the company does not release detailed financials.

Colleagues say Raval’s management style is austere. He begins meetings before dawn, avoids debt, and demands written plans before new projects are approved. “He spends more time in factories than offices,” said one executive who has worked with him for 15 years. “He trusts machines more than PowerPoint.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Devki diverted oxygen from its steel plants to public hospitals at no charge—a move that drew national attention and underscored Raval’s reputation for quiet philanthropy. His foundation funds schools, medical programs, and scholarships for low-income students.

In interviews, Raval often recalls his years as a priest, describing them as management training in disguise. “The temple taught me to serve before I lead,” he said in one broadcast. That ethos, coupled with meticulous cost control, has earned him the nickname “Guru”—a title employees use with a mix of respect and pragmatism.

Today, Devki Group employs more than 7,000 people and continues to expand across the region, including new clinker and steel facilities financed through retained earnings rather than outside investors.

For his industrial and philanthropic work, Raval has received the Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear (EBS), one of Kenya’s highest civilian honors. He maintains no public office and rarely grants interviews.

At dusk in Athi River, when the furnaces cool and the shifts change, Raval’s car leaves the compound without escort. The guard at the gate salutes quietly. In a nation where industry often depends on foreign capital, the man who began as a monk built an empire out of faith—in numbers, in effort, and in Kenya itself.
