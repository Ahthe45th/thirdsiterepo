Eric Kinoti

Entrepreneur · Founder of Shade Systems East Africa

He was born in Mombasa in 1984, where the sun is relentless and ambition must work through the heat. Eric Kinoti learned enterprise by carrying milk crates before dawn. His father ran a hotel; the boy handled supplies. The lessons stuck: service, patience, persuasion.

By his twenties he was delivering milk to Nairobi’s restaurants when he noticed something odd—everyone complained about bad tents and expensive imports. He borrowed $6 000 and started Shade Systems in a single-room workshop in Industrial Area.

The orders came slowly, then suddenly. Hotels, schools, ministries — they all needed cover. He gave them shade and in return earned light. Within years he was exporting across the region, employing hundreds, and mentoring youth through talks that treated failure as tuition.

Named to Forbes Africa’s Top 30 Under 30, Kinoti became a poster face for Kenyan grit. But behind the awards is a simpler truth: he saw a gap, filled it, and kept his promises. Every tent he raises is a reminder that dreams, too, need structure.
