Vimal Shah
Chairman, Bidco Africa

In the mist-heavy mornings of Nyeri, where tea fields blur into forest and trucks climb toward Mount Kenya, a young boy once watched his father count the day’s earnings on the counter of a small shop.  That boy, Vimal Shah, learned early that numbers could tell stories — of hunger, of survival, of beginnings.

His father, Bhimji Depar Shah, had come from India with nothing but trade in his hands.  The family sold clothes and groceries to farmers who paid in coins rubbed thin by use.  Vimal stocked shelves, swept floors, listened.  He grew fluent in the quiet grammar of enterprise long before he learned its theories.

School carried him to Nairobi Primary, then Highway Secondary, then to the University of Nairobi, where he studied business and finance.  Yet the true syllabus lay elsewhere — in Kenya’s restless 1980s, when an emerging middle class was discovering soap, cooking oil, and the idea that local goods could rival imported ones.  With his father and brother Tarun, Vimal turned that realization into an experiment: a small factory, one production line, a dream named Bidco.

The operation began in the heat and clang of machinery, not in air-conditioned boardrooms.  It produced soap, then cooking oil, then more.  What started as survival work in a tin-roofed shed evolved, under Vimal’s steady instinct, into one of East Africa’s largest manufacturers of everyday life — oils, detergents, beverages, and personal-care brands stacked on kiosks from Mombasa to Gulu.

Bidco’s rise mirrored Kenya’s own industrial adolescence: messy, improvisational, propelled by faith in markets that did not yet exist.  Vimal built backward as well as forward — owning supply chains, investing in energy efficiency, insisting that the continent could manufacture for itself.  He made vertical integration sound like patriotism.

Those who know him describe a man who speaks softly but acts with mathematical precision.  When he stepped aside as chief executive in 2012 to become chairman, it was less retreat than design: an insistence that succession, too, must be engineered.  Beyond the factory gates, he championed youth entrepreneurship and green production, arguing that profit and responsibility need not quarrel.

Today Bidco employs thousands and sells to millions.  Yet Shah’s presence remains disarmingly calm — a businessman who treats capitalism as craft, not conquest.  In a region long accustomed to foreign monopolies, he became proof that industry could grow indigenous roots.  His legacy sits in warehouses and kitchens alike: tangible, utilitarian, and distinctly East African.

He was not born to applause.  He built toward it — one bar of soap, one belief in possibility, at a time.
