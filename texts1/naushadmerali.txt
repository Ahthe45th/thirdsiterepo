Naushad Merali

Founder, Sameer Group

He was born on the first morning of 1951, as Nairobi woke to a new year and a slow post-colonial dawn.  Naushad Merali came from an Ismaili family that prized diligence over display.  His father ran a small business; his son would turn that ethic into empire.

After schooling at Highway Secondary, he trained in accountancy in Britain, returning with crisp manners and keener mathematics.  He began as a finance clerk, then bought a share in Ryce Motors.  It was a quiet takeover that foreshadowed many to come.

Merali built the Sameer Group from fragments — tyres, telecommunications, agriculture, construction.  He negotiated joint ventures with Japan’s Yana and France’s Alcatel long before global partnerships became fashion.  His hallmark was timing: buy undervalued, build value, exit gracefully.  In 2004 he executed a deal that made him legend — selling his Kencell stake to Celtel within hours, netting millions before markets could blink.

Yet he lived without fanfare.  His philanthropy — through the Zarina and Naushad Merali Foundation — funded hospitals and schools quietly.  He preferred a handshake to a headline.  When he died in 2021, Nairobi mourned not just a billionaire, but a craftsman of capital who proved that power can whisper.
