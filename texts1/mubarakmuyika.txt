Mubarak Muyika

Tech Entrepreneur, Founder of Zagace and Hype Century

He was eleven when he lost both parents.  Western Kenya, 2005 — a boy left to relatives and to his own quick mind.  Where others saw computers as toys, he saw code as language.

At Friends School Kamusinga he built his first content-management system to rescue a family publishing business.  By sixteen he had turned it into Hype Century, a web-hosting company that grew faster than anyone could supervise.  He sold it before finishing his teens and used the proceeds to build something bigger: Zagace, a cloud platform offering accounting, HR, and inventory tools for small African firms.

Forbes noticed.  So did Jack Ma.  But Muyika resisted the foreign exits that seduce young founders.  He chose independence over injection.  His logic was continental: if Africa keeps selling its start-ups, it will never own its future.

Now in his early thirties, he operates between Nairobi and the world — proof that orphanhood need not preclude ownership, and that code can be as revolutionary as capital.  He belongs to the first generation that treats technology not as miracle, but as birthright.
