Eric Kinoti

Founder, Shade Systems East Africa

At sunrise in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, the clang of hammers and the smell of canvas hang in the air. Men in grease-stained uniforms stretch out fabric under the open roof of a workshop. Above them, a sign reads Shade Systems East Africa. Inside, Eric Kinoti paces between workstations, stopping to inspect a tent pole. “If it can’t survive the wind,” he says, “it doesn’t leave this yard.”

Kinoti was born in Mombasa in 1984, the son of a hotelier who taught him the rhythms of service early—how to read people, how to keep things running. But money was scarce, and when he left for secondary school in Meru, he carried more grit than privilege. “I learned early that no one is coming to save you,” he said. “You build your own rescue.”

After high school, college felt out of reach. Instead, he began selling milk to Nairobi hotels, waking before dawn to deliver crates from a borrowed pickup truck. The pay was meager, but the lessons were sharp. “You learn how to take a no and turn it into a maybe,” he said with a laugh.

One morning, while unloading at a hotel, he overheard a manager complaining about imported tents—too costly, too slow to arrive. It stuck with him. “I went home thinking, why can’t we make them here?”

In 2009, with a $6,000 loan and no factory experience, Kinoti launched Shade Systems East Africa. His first office was a single room in Nairobi’s Industrial Area; his first hires were two tailors. They stitched tent fabric by hand. The early months were brutal. Orders fell through, suppliers vanished, and one contractor ran off with his designs. “You either quit,” he says, “or you start again with better locks.”

He started again. And again. Within a few years, Shade Systems was manufacturing canopies, tarpaulins, and large-scale shade structures for hotels, NGOs, schools, and government projects. The company now supplies clients across East and Central Africa.

His workdays remain long. He visits every site himself, often driving through the night to supervise installations. His philosophy is simple: “If you’re too big to get your hands dirty, you’re too small to lead.”

Kinoti has since founded several other ventures, including SafiSana Home Services and Bag Base Kenya, but Shade Systems remains his flagship. Alongside business, he mentors young entrepreneurs, sharing his own missteps as freely as his successes. “I tell them, don’t chase funding—chase consistency,” he says.

He’s been named among Forbes Africa’s Top 30 Under 30 and won multiple awards for innovation. Yet his office is modest—metal chairs, worn desk, a small photo of his first workshop tacked to the wall. “That’s where everything started,” he says. “If you forget that, you lose the plot.”

As the afternoon light filters through the open roof, workers hoist a finished canopy onto a truck bound for the coast. Kinoti watches, hands in pockets, nodding slightly. “People think entrepreneurship is freedom,” he says. “It’s actually responsibility. Every pole that stands here holds someone’s trust.”
