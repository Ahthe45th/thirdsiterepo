Joseph Mucheru

Technologist and Former Cabinet Secretary for ICT

Kikuyu town, 1968.  Kenya was five years old, and the idea of the internet belonged to science fiction.  Yet Joseph Mucheru grew up asking how systems connect — wires, people, nations.

From Lenana School to the University of Nairobi, he studied economics and computer science, pairing logic with curiosity.  A stint in London refined his discipline, but home drew him back.

At Google he became one of the architects of its Sub-Saharan presence, laying cables and partnerships that would digitize a continent.  Then in 2015, the government called.  As Cabinet Secretary for ICT, he pushed broadband into counties, nurtured startups, drafted data-protection laws, and turned the phrase Silicon Savannah from metaphor into ministry.

When he left office, he returned to venture work — investing in clean tech and education, mentoring founders with the calm of a man who has seen both code and Cabinet.  His legacy runs through fiber and policy alike: a Kenya more connected, and a public servant who treated technology as nation-building, not novelty.
