Dr. Yasin Abu Bakr

Founder and Chairman, ALIF LAA MEEM Enterprises

In a quiet office in Kilimani, Nairobi, the walls are lined not with glossy portraits but with maps: eastern Congo’s mineral corridors, Somalia’s coastal ports, planned housing sites outside Nairobi. At a long table, Dr. Yasin Abu Bakr leans over a draft financing model for a new public-private project. He speaks softly, almost clinically. “Money,” he says, “has one job. To move.”

Abu Bakr was born in 1974 in Nairobi, the youngest of six children. His father died when he was still a boy. His mother, widowed at 26, raised the family in close orbit with Kenya’s early post-independence elite. The names around the dinner table were the names shaping the young republic: Jomo Kenyatta, Mbiyu Koinange, senior State House officials. His uncle, Wycliff Rading Omollo, served as deputy comptroller of State House. Power, for him, was not mythology. It was proximity, and expectation.

His lineage ran deep. On his father’s side, he traces descent from Odera Okang’a, the Luo strongman and educationist, and from Jakobo O’dhek, a Luo paramount chief. On his mother’s side, he is the grandson of Timothy Omondo, an educationist linked to the political rise of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Kenya’s first vice president. Those histories meant two things: access — and scrutiny.

But the defining force in his early life was not the State. It was his mother. She left her corporate post at Magadi Soda in the early 1980s and built, almost from nothing, a wholesale distribution network across Nairobi. She moved consumer goods at scale. She later invested in low-cost rental housing in informal settlements, an asset base valued at about $3 million by the time of her death in 2015. Yasin watched all of it up close. By 10, he understood terms like X-Factory pricing and FMCG turnover not as theory but as survival.

He went to St. Mary’s School, Nairobi — the elite Catholic school known for producing presidents, ministers, and chief executives. He finished his International Baccalaureate there, then left Kenya. In Boston, he studied finance and insurance at Northeastern University while enrolled in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. He later moved to London and studied law at the London School of Economics. After converting to Islam, he went to Al-Azhar University in Cairo to study Islamic Sharia.

By his early 20s, before most of his peers had chosen careers, he had already tried to build one. He launched ELLAK — a Kenyan version of Blockbuster Video — and a vegetable distribution network supplying kale, cabbage, and spinach to Nairobi households. He also ran a water delivery business serving neighborhoods in the city that went dry for days at a time. The ventures didn’t all survive, especially after he left for university, but the instinct was clear: find the gap, fill it, formalize it.

He worked stints in finance — Shamut Bank, BayBank Boston, Bank of Boston — and later in defense work with McDonnell Douglas and at the Pentagon. In London, he spent most of his time embedded in Barclays Bank. The thread through all of it was systems: how money is structured, how risk is priced, how power travels across borders.

When he came back to Kenya in the early 2000s, the country was on the edge of political transition. The old order was weakening; the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) was rising. Abu Bakr moved quietly inside that turbulence. He built HouseCottages, an affordable housing concept that would later echo in President William Ruto’s housing agenda. He built Credit One, Kenya’s first payday lender — later acquired by Platinum Credit, and widely seen as the template for Kenya’s flood of short-term mobile lending products. He then set up Kensington Orient, introducing insurance premium financing to the local market.

Then he went further — into Islamic finance. Working with the Central Bank of Kenya, he helped bring to market the country’s first Islamic banks, First Community Bank and Gulf African Bank, and later Takaful Insurance, offering Shariah-compliant cover. His model was direct: take a viable idea, pull in the right investors fast, get regulatory blessing, and scale before anyone else is prepared to compete. “If you wait for permission,” he has said, “you’ve already lost the window.”

By the 2010s, his work had moved beyond Kenya. He began advising governments and power brokers in Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, Somalia, even the DRC — usually on how to finance state priorities without surrendering leverage. He is close to senior figures around Uganda’s first family; he is respected in Tanzania’s business and religious circles; he is known in Nairobi’s political class as a man whose backing matters. His influence is both visible and deniable. People in his orbit describe him less as a banker than as an operator.

ALIF LAA MEEM ENTERPRISES, the firm he now chairs, is built to package and deliver Shariah-compliant financial structures — sukuk, infrastructure bonds, public-private development vehicles — to African governments. It runs out of London and Kenya’s coast, and it sees major public projects long before they become public talking points.

Those who work with him describe a consistent method: he moves fast, cuts emotion out of negotiations, and tells investors, bluntly, that if they trust him, their money will multiply 200 or 300 times in a few years. “He doesn’t pitch,” said one associate. “He predicts.”

Politically, he does not hide his bets. He backed Uhuru Kenyatta over Raila Odinga. When Uhuru Kenyatta later broke with his deputy, he backed William Ruto — and Ruto won. In Uganda, his counsel is heard at State House through Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba. In Tanzania, his access crosses both religious and commercial lines.

He is 51 now. He talks in terms of leverage, liquidity, risk insulation. But he also returns, often, to his mother. “She taught me two things,” he says. “That money is for making more money. And that the harder you work, the luckier you get.”

From Kilimani, his work reaches Kampala, Dar es Salaam, Addis Ababa, Mogadishu. Little of it is advertised. Much of it is structural. In his telling, that is the point. “Noise burns energy,” he says. “Structure builds states.”
