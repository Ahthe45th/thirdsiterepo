Chris Kirubi

Industrialist, Investor, Media Tycoon

He grew up in the shadows of Empire — Nairobi 1941, an orphan before adolescence, selling newspapers for coins that smelled of ink and sweat.  From scarcity, Chris Kirubi learned improvisation; from rejection, resolve.

He studied in Germany, absorbing the post-war ethic of rebuilding from ruin.  Back home he joined Shell, then left to chart his own map.  In the 1970s he began buying derelict buildings, painting, repairing, reselling.  Real estate became redemption.  Profit followed.

Then came diversification — Haco Industries in manufacturing, Centum Investment in finance, Capital FM in media.  He moved easily between boardrooms and radio booths, a businessman who could also play DJ.  His style was sharp, his advice blunt.  “You cannot wait for luck,” he told Kenya’s youth.  “You create it.”

Cancer slowed him but did not silence him.  When he died in 2021, tributes spoke of audacity — the orphan who became a mogul, the man who proved that local ambition could match global scale.

He left towers, factories, and frequencies.  But his true estate is intangible: the permission he gave a generation to dream loudly.
