Bhimji Depar Shah

Founder, Bidco Group

In a warehouse on the outskirts of Thika, sacks of raw palm kernels are stacked shoulder-high, the air heavy with heat and oil. Workers move in practiced rhythm—pour, grind, refine. To most, it is another workday in Kenya’s manufacturing corridor. To those who know the story, every drum of oil traces back to a single immigrant who arrived with nothing but a merchant’s instinct and an unshakable belief in building.

Bhimji Depar Shah came to Kenya from India in the 1950s, one of thousands drawn by the promise of post-colonial trade. He was in his twenties and carried few possessions. Nyeri, a misty town in the country’s central highlands, became his home. There, he opened a small textiles and household goods shop—barely enough to sustain his young family, but sufficient to set down roots.

From behind that counter, Shah studied what people bought, what they needed, and what they couldn’t find locally. Kenya was still dependent on imported consumer goods; multinational brands dominated shelves. He began to imagine a business that would change that balance.

In the early 1980s he founded Bidco Industries, starting with garments before shifting to soap and edible oils. The first factory was little more than a corrugated shed, with machines that groaned through daily blackouts. But Shah and his sons, Vimal and Tarun, worked through the noise and scarcity, reinvesting every profit. They built relationships with farmers, transporters, and retailers—an ecosystem that would, over decades, turn Bidco into one of East Africa’s largest manufacturers.

He never studied business formally, yet his decisions carried the precision of a trained economist. He integrated supply chains, sourced locally, and pushed for efficiency long before those became corporate slogans. As Bidco expanded across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, its products—Kimbo, Elianto, Powerboy—became staples of daily life.

Shah rarely spoke to the press and almost never appeared at public events. Colleagues described him as reserved, deeply observant, and relentless about quality. “He didn’t need to say much,” one longtime employee recalled. “He would walk through the factory and you’d feel the standard rise.”

In 2007, Forbes estimated his wealth at more than $700 million, ranking him among Kenya’s richest men. But those close to him say he measured success differently—in jobs created, in the independence of a local firm competing with global giants. He often reminded his sons that “a factory is only as good as the community around it.”

In later years he stepped back from daily operations, allowing Vimal to lead as chief executive and then chairman. Yet his imprint remains visible: in the company’s discipline, in its emphasis on Kenyan ownership, in the simple conviction that manufacturing could be a patriotic act.

At the Thika plant that grew from his first vision, the hum of machinery carries on. Workers still speak his name quietly, with a kind of familial respect. “He started it all,” one says, nodding toward the production line. “From a shop. From nothing.”
