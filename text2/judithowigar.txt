Judith Owigar

Technologist, Entrepreneur, Co-founder of AkiraChix

On a Tuesday morning in Nairobi’s Karen suburb, a dozen young women gather around a whiteboard covered in code. Their laptops hum softly, stickers peeling at the corners: #WomenInTech, #CodeLikeAGirl. Standing at the front, Judith Owigar moves between desks, checking screens, correcting syntax. “It’s not magic,” she says with a small smile. “It’s logic.”

Born in 1987 in Nairobi, Owigar grew up in a modest family that believed in education and faith but had little connection to technology. Her father, a civil servant, worked long hours; her mother ran the household with quiet precision. “They didn’t understand computers,” Owigar recalls. “But they understood determination.”

At St. George’s Girls Secondary School, she first saw a computer lab—dusty monitors, unstable internet, but possibility glowing on every screen. She stayed late after classes to practice typing and soon learned to code. At the University of Nairobi, she majored in computer science, one of only a handful of women in her class. Later, she earned a master’s in applied computing.

Her early jobs were technical but lonely. She worked as a systems analyst and consultant, often the only woman in the room. “People assumed I was the secretary,” she said in a 2018 interview. “You learn to prove yourself twice before you’re heard once.”

In 2010, together with three friends, she co-founded AkiraChix, a training program designed to equip women from underprivileged backgrounds with tech skills—from coding to robotics to digital entrepreneurship. They began in borrowed classrooms, teaching on weekends with secondhand computers. “We didn’t want charity,” Owigar said. “We wanted opportunity.”

Over the years, AkiraChix grew into one of East Africa’s most respected tech programs, producing hundreds of female developers and engineers now working across the region. Alumni have launched startups, led corporate teams, and mentored others. “It’s not just about code,” she says. “It’s about confidence.”

Owigar’s approach is practical, deliberate. She rarely seeks the spotlight and speaks softly, but her influence runs deep. She has served as president of LinuxChix Kenya, won fellowships from TechWomen and the Anita Borg Institute, and represented Kenya on international panels. Her voice carries the steady authority of someone who has lived the gap she’s trying to close.

Inside the AkiraChix campus, the walls are painted with affirmations—Think, Build, Empower. On a shelf in her office sits a single photo: her first class of students, holding up certificates and grinning into the sun. “They taught me,” she says quietly. “That resilience is contagious.”

As the session ends, the students shut their laptops, the air buzzing with small talk and laughter. Owigar stays behind for a moment, erasing the board, eyes on the faint traces of code left behind. “This,” she says, “is how change looks in real time. Not loud. Just consistent.”
