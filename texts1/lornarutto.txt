Lorna Rutto

Social Entrepreneur · Founder of EcoPost

Nairobi in the 1980s was a city learning how to breathe through its own waste. Plastic clogged the rivers, wrapped around trees, filled the air with the smell of burning. In that cluttered ecosystem, a girl named Lorna Rutto saw both ruin and raw material.

She grew up in Kaptembwo, a low-income neighborhood where hope had to be crafted by hand. Her parents prized honesty and education over ease. At school she was curious and stubborn, dismantling toys to see how they worked, re-assembling them into something new. At Strathmore University she studied commerce, then joined a bank in Nairobi—steady pay, polished floors, numb routine. But the city outside her office window kept calling: the heaps of plastic that nobody wanted.

In 2010 she walked away from her desk and founded EcoPost, a small factory with a large idea: turn plastic waste into fencing posts stronger than timber and kinder to the earth. She borrowed money, built machines from scraps, hired youths who once picked garbage for food. Each post they molded saved a tree and rescued a dignity.

The journey was uneven—permits delayed, investors skeptical, machines breaking mid-shift—but the product worked. Kenya’s farmers bought in; parks fenced with her posts; the world noticed. Awards came: Cartier Women’s Initiative, World Economic Forum honors, CNN profiles. Yet Lorna kept her language plain: “We are just cleaning our home,” she would say.

In a continent where sustainability is too often imported rhetoric, she made it a local craft. She proved that waste can be wealth, and that repairing the earth is also an act of self-respect. Every fence post from her factory is a quiet protest against despair —and a promise that Kenya’s future can be built from its own discarded pieces.
