Tabitha Karanja

Founder and CEO, Keroche Breweries

Near Lake Naivasha, where wind moves through acacia like a whispered dare, a young woman once decided that an industry owned by foreigners could be rewritten by a Kenyan mother.

Born in 1964, Tabitha Mukami Muigai grew up in Nakuru County — disciplined home, steady school, no silver lines.  After Bahati Girls High and studies in business and accounting, she joined the Ministry of Tourism, a respectable desk, a quiet life.  But respectability bored her.

With her husband Joseph, she opened a hardware shop in Naivasha.  The margins were thin, the market crowded.  She looked instead at the bottles on the shelves — beer imported, expensive, monopolized.  She saw opportunity fermenting.  In 1997, she founded Keroche Industries, producing fortified wines for the low-income market.  Success brought scrutiny.  Taxes rose, accusations flew, but she endured.  A decade later she pivoted again — this time to beer.  Summit Lager flowed from her new plant, its foam a statement of independence.

Each litre that left her factory challenged a century of colonial habit — the belief that Kenya could consume but not create.  She fought regulators, court cases, and gendered condescension, often alone at the microphones.  Yet Keroche grew, one brew at a time, until it stood beside global brands on Kenyan shelves.

In 2022, voters sent her to the Senate.  She carried the same defiance to Parliament — polished now, but unbroken.  Her story is less about alcohol than agency: how a woman in her thirties took on an empire and outlasted it.

Tabitha Karanja brewed not just beer, but belief — that Kenyan women could own industry, not just staff it.
