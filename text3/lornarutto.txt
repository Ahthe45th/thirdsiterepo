Lorna Rutto

Social Entrepreneur, Founder of EcoPost

At a recycling yard on the outskirts of Nairobi, conveyor belts grind through heaps of discarded plastic—detergent bottles, water caps, food wrappers. The noise is constant, the air acrid. Near the sorting line, Lorna Rutto checks a gauge on an extruder turning shredded waste into long, dark fence posts. Each one replaces a tree that would have been cut for timber.

Rutto, now 40, founded EcoPost Ltd. in 2010 with a premise that was equal parts business and ecology: turn Kenya’s plastic crisis into construction material. The company’s polymer posts are cheaper than timber, resistant to termites, and designed for the fencing market that consumes thousands of trees each year.

Born in 1985 in Nairobi and raised in Kaptembwo, a low-income neighborhood in Nakuru, Rutto grew up surrounded by the city’s uncollected garbage. She began repurposing waste as a teenager—melting discarded plastic into handmade jewelry she sold to classmates. After earning a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce and Accounting from Strathmore University, she joined a commercial bank as a credit officer. The desk job paid reliably but felt detached from the problem she saw daily: plastic choking Nairobi’s drainage canals and farms.

She left banking after two years, raising small grants and family savings to build the first EcoPost plant—a single machine in an industrial shed. Output was limited, about 50 posts a day, but demand grew. Within five years, production scaled to more than 2,000 posts a week, supplied to farmers, park services, and construction firms. The company now employs over 100 people directly and contracts hundreds of informal waste collectors, mostly women and youth, who deliver raw plastic for payment by weight.

EcoPost’s model is circular rather than charitable. The firm purchases waste, processes it, and sells a durable product into an existing market. Analysts estimate that since inception, EcoPost has recycled more than 10 million kilograms of plastic and saved roughly 350,000 trees from being cut for fencing.

Rutto’s business has attracted global recognition: the Cartier Women’s Initiative Award, the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, and selection as a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She uses the visibility to lobby for policy reform—extended producer responsibility, waste-segregation laws, and municipal recycling infrastructure.

Inside EcoPost’s compound, the metrics are practical, not poetic. Every week supervisors tally tonnage processed, sales completed, and kilograms diverted from landfills. Profit margins are thin but steady. The company plans to expand into plastic lumber for housing and transport pallets, targeting regional markets in Uganda and Tanzania.

Colleagues describe Rutto as meticulous and risk-averse. “She runs a factory, not a movement,” said one longtime engineer. “The activism is in the output.”

In a country where environmental work often stops at awareness campaigns, Rutto turned waste into a functional supply chain—proof that sustainability can operate as industry, not ideology.

At the yard, a forklift lifts a bundle of finished posts onto a truck bound for Narok. Rutto watches as it pulls away. The ground under her feet is littered with plastic scraps—raw material for the next batch, and for an economy learning that conservation can also mean production.
