Lorna Rutto

Social Entrepreneur, Founder of EcoPost

On the outskirts of Nairobi, near the industrial area where trucks growl and smoke thickens the air, rows of dark fencing posts line the yard of a small factory. They look like wood—solid, grain-textured—but each one began as plastic waste pulled from the city’s gutters and dumpsites. “We’re cleaning up, one fence at a time,” says Lorna Rutto, her voice steady over the hum of shredding machines.

Born in 1985 in Kaptembwo, a low-income neighborhood in Nakuru, Rutto grew up surrounded by littered streets and overflowing landfills. She remembers rivers choked with bags, playgrounds filled with trash. “It was normal then,” she said once. “You didn’t notice it until you realized it shouldn’t be.”

Her parents, both civil servants, pushed their children toward education as a way out. Rutto attended local public schools, then earned a degree in commerce and accounting from Strathmore University. After graduation, she took a job at a bank. The work was stable, but sterile. “Every day, I watched people move money around,” she said. “And I kept thinking, what are we actually fixing?”

In 2010, at 25, she resigned—without investors, without a safety net—to launch EcoPost. Her idea was radical in its simplicity: collect plastic waste, melt it, and mold it into durable fence posts that could replace timber. The environmental impact would be twofold—cleaning the streets and saving Kenya’s fast-disappearing forests.

The first months were chaotic. Machines broke. Suppliers disappeared. Cash ran out. “We were recycling before recycling was fashionable,” she recalled. Still, she pressed on, collecting discarded plastic from dumpsites and hiring youth and women from informal settlements to sort and process it.

The breakthrough came when local farmers and wildlife conservancies began buying the posts. They were cheaper than wood, immune to termites, and weatherproof. Demand surged.

Awards followed. Rutto won the Cartier Women’s Initiative Award, became a Fellow of the Unreasonable Institute, and was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. Her story spread on CNN and in The Guardian—a portrait of an entrepreneur redefining sustainability from the Global South.

But at the factory, fame feels distant. Workers feed plastic chips into the extruder; the heat is stifling, the rhythm constant. “This is what success looks like here,” Rutto says, gesturing at the production line. “Not glossy offices. Just work that matters.”

Today, EcoPost employs dozens and has recycled millions of kilograms of plastic. Rutto still walks through Nairobi’s informal settlements, where collectors sell her company their daily hauls. She knows most by name. “It’s a chain,” she says. “You clean the city, you save a tree, you feed a family.”

Outside, a truck reverses slowly, its bed stacked with black posts bound for Laikipia. As it pulls away, Rutto wipes her hands and smiles. “We’re not solving everything,” she says. “But at least, we’re not part of the problem.”
