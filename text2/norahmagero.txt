Norah Magero

Mechanical Engineer, Innovator, Co-founder of Drop Access

In a remote clinic in western Kenya, a nurse opens a small blue cooler and lifts out a vial of vaccine. Outside, the midday sun presses hard, the roads are rough, and power is unreliable. But inside the cooler, the temperature holds steady. It is one of Norah Magero’s inventions—compact, solar-powered, and quietly lifesaving.

Born in 1988 in Kakamega County, Magero grew up surrounded by green hills and long rains. Her childhood was modest but full of curiosity. “I wanted to understand how things worked,” she says. “Especially the things people said girls couldn’t fix.”

At Butere Girls High School, she gravitated toward science, often lingering after class to work on physics experiments others found tedious. Later, she earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Her notebooks, classmates recall, were filled not just with equations but with small sketches of machines she wanted to build someday.

After graduation, Magero joined Kenya’s energy sector, designing systems and consulting on renewable power projects. The work was technical, precise—but something bothered her. “We were talking about access,” she says, “but we were designing for people who already had it.”

In 2018, she co-founded Drop Access, a social enterprise developing off-grid energy solutions for rural communities. Their work began small—solar systems for farmers, mobile charging stations for women’s cooperatives—but one idea soon stood out. What if the same technology could preserve medicine where electricity was scarce?

From that question came Vaccibox: a lightweight, solar-powered refrigerator for transporting and storing vaccines. It could fit on a motorbike, run for hours without fuel, and keep doses safe in regions where children had long been left out of immunization programs.

In 2022, the Royal Academy of Engineering awarded Magero the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation, making her the first Kenyan and the first woman to win it. The prize brought international attention—but also pressure. “Awards don’t fix the problem,” she says. “Deployment does.”

Today, Drop Access operates across several counties, partnering with health centers and government agencies. The work is slow, field-heavy, dependent on logistics and persistence. Yet for Magero, it’s personal. “I grew up seeing how far women would walk to get medicine,” she says. “No one should lose a child because a fridge failed.”

At a warehouse in Nairobi where new Vaccibox units are assembled, she moves easily among technicians, checking solar panels, reviewing assembly steps. Her manner is calm but exacting. When she spots a loose wire, she fixes it herself. “Engineering,” she says, “isn’t about machines. It’s about people.”

As dusk settles outside, the power flickers briefly before stabilizing on the solar grid. In the corner, one of her coolers hums quietly, its digital gauge steady at 4°C. It’s a small, persistent sound—the measure of one woman’s determination to bring reliability to places long denied it.
