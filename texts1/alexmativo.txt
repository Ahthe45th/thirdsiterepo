Alex Mativo

Tech Entrepreneur · Founder of E-LAB and DABD

Nairobi, 1993. A city between analog and algorithm. In a middle-class apartment stacked with old televisions and defunct radios, a boy named Alex Mativo found beauty in broken circuits.

He attended Strathmore School, where discipline was daily and excellence non-negotiable. While classmates dreamed of careers abroad, he dreamed of what to do with Kenya’s mountain of e-waste. At twenty he founded E-LAB, collecting discarded electronics from dumpsites and turning them into art, fashion, and raw materials. Circuit boards became necklaces; hard drives became handbags. Technology met craft and found redemption.

Recognition followed: UNESCO Youth Ambassador for Peace, Queen’s Young Leader, CNN features. But Mativo treated awards as invitations, not destinations. He launched DABD to help African small businesses brand themselves digitally, to look global without losing local voice.

His offices smell of solder and coffee, and his message is simple: innovation is not invention; it is attention—to the problems everyone has learned to ignore. Alex Mativo stands in the long shadow of Africa’s waste heaps and insists they can be its next resource. He is part engineer, part artist, entirely believer.
