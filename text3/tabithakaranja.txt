Tabitha Karanja

Founder and Chief Executive, Keroche Breweries

In the bottling hall of Keroche Breweries in Naivasha, robotic arms lift glass bottles under a haze of carbon dioxide. The hum of compressors drowns out the Rift Valley wind outside. On the mezzanine, Tabitha Karanja walks a tight circuit between control panels and spreadsheets. Every gauge, every batch report, still passes through her hands.

Born in 1964 in Nakuru County, Karanja grew up near the rim of Lake Naivasha, where subsistence farming met the early stirrings of agribusiness. Her parents, small-scale traders, emphasized education over inheritance. After finishing Bahati Girls High School, she studied business administration and accounting, entering the Ministry of Tourism as a junior clerk. The civil-service career was stable but slow. Within a few years she left to join her husband, Joseph Karanja, in a hardware business.

Margins in hardware were thin; regulation was heavy. She began studying consumption patterns and saw a void in Kenya’s alcohol industry, then dominated by a single multinational producer. In 1997, the couple registered Keroche Industries, initially producing fortified wine aimed at low-income consumers neglected by major brewers. Sales grew, but so did scrutiny. Competitors accused the firm of exploiting tax gaps; regulators raised excise duties.

The turning point came a decade later. Rather than fold, Karanja reinvested in a full-scale beer plant. By 2007, Keroche was manufacturing its own lagers under the brand Summit—becoming the first Kenyan-owned brewery to challenge the foreign monopoly head-on. The plant cost more than $25 million, financed through retained profits and local bank loans.

Industry analysts called the move reckless. Kenya’s market was saturated, distribution networks locked by incumbents. Yet Keroche expanded—automating production, adding malt handling, and building a second brewhouse. The company’s capacity has since grown from 40,000 to over 200,000 bottles an hour, employing several hundred workers.

Karanja’s approach is pragmatic and procedural. She monitors cash flow daily, signs off on procurement personally, and keeps tight control of marketing spend. “We are not in the entertainment business,” she told a trade forum in 2021. “We are in manufacturing.” Her insistence on compliance—documenting every liter produced and tax paid—became part of the firm’s defense as it faced a series of Kenya Revenue Authority audits and legal disputes that continue to test the regulatory framework for local producers.

In 2022, Karanja entered politics, elected Senator for Nakuru County on a platform of economic equity and fair competition. Her move was less ideological than protective—an attempt to shape the laws that govern small- and mid-sized manufacturers. In Parliament she sits on finance and industry committees, often citing her factory’s experience as evidence of policy distortion.

Keroche remains privately held, with annual output exceeding 100 million liters and a growing portfolio of beers and spirits. Analysts describe the company as a “proof of concept” for indigenous industrialization: a Kenyan brand built without multinational backing, surviving on operational discipline and market persistence.

At dusk, as the plant’s lights reflect off the stainless-steel tanks, Karanja leaves the control room. She pauses at the observation deck where pallets of Summit bottles are shrink-wrapped for transport. “This line,” she says quietly, “is my Parliament.”
