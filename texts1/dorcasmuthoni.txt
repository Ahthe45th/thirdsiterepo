Dorcas Muthoni

Engineer and Founder of Openworld and AfChix

She was born in the late 1970s, when Kenya’s electricity still blinked through blackouts and computers were curiosities locked in laboratories.  Yet Dorcas Muthoni looked at the wires and saw possibility.

From public schools to the University of Nairobi’s Computer Science department, she moved through environments not built for women.  She wrote code in rooms that doubted her and built systems that soon hired them.  At twenty-four she founded Openworld, delivering software infrastructure for governments and NGOs that could not afford failure.

Her second creation, AfChix, became a lifeline — a pan-African network mentoring women in technology, teaching code, confidence, and community.  Hundreds have passed through its workshops; many now lead their own companies.

In 2014, the Internet Society inducted her into the Hall of Fame.  She treated it as motivation, not monument.  Her work continues to bridge the digital divide quietly, methodically, one trained girl at a time.

Dorcas Muthoni’s genius is not in algorithms but in access — proving that empowerment, like software, runs best when shared.
