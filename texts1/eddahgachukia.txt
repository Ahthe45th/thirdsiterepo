Dr. Eddah Gachukia

Educationist · Co-founder of Riara Group of Schools

Kiambu, 1936. A girl born into a world where learning was a luxury for men. Eddah Gachukia refused to accept that script.

At Alliance Girls and Makerere University she excelled, later earning a PhD from the University of Nairobi. She taught, researched, served in UNESCO and Parliament, arguing that education is the first infrastructure of a nation.

In 1974 she and her husband Dan began Riara Schools in their home — a nursery class that grew into a university. Her philosophy was steady: teach for character before career. Thousands of students have passed through Riara’s corridors, each carrying a piece of her belief that excellence and ethics must walk together.

Decorated with the Moran and Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear, she still speaks softly about curricula and citizenship. Dr. Gachukia built more than schools; she built a moral architecture for Kenya’s youth.
